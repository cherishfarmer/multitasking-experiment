### About
In this experiment, we are investigating how performance on a primary cognitive task is influenced by secondary tasks that act as interruptions.

Our experiment consists of a 2x2 factorial design within-subjects design. The primary task is the same among all conditions, with each condition having a different secondary task. We use two independent variables: source type and intensity:
- Same vs. Different Resource: in relation to the primary task. Same resource tasks included word searches, while different resource tasks included visual searches.
- Easy vs. Hard: for each resource type, we have an easy and hard version.
